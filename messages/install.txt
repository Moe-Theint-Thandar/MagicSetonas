Thank you for installing MagicSetonas -- a syntax highlighter for
cutting edge Setonas.

You're almost there, please do the following steps to finish
the installation:

* Close all open Setonas files;

* Disable the "Python" package:

  - via Package Control by executing "Package Control: Disable Package";

  - or manually, by adding "Python" to "ignored_packages", in your
    `Preferences.sublime-settings` file.

If you find any oddities in how your Python code is highlighted, please
